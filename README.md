# TeamForm
This program takes in a roster of employees and a task list and, creates a team best able to complete the list according to the employeeâ€™s skills by using a genetic algorithm.
First create a roster object using makeditroster.java. In this object you create the list of employees with their skillset and skill level.

Then run the teamFormationAlgorithm.java to run the program that will create the team. This program will ask for the roster file AND a task list( a txt file with 1 task per line). Enter your parameters for the program including teamsize, number of generations, initial population, mutation chance, lifetime, an optimal number of tasks and an optimal quality. The program prints the best team to complete the tasklist.
